## [v1.0.0] - Launching Everything Antigravity

### 🌍 LinkedIn
🚀 Exciting News! I just released "Everything Antigravity" v1.0.0 - a comprehensive framework for autonomous AI coding workflows!

Inspired by the "Triad Pattern," this ecosystem brings together specialized AI Agents, hierarchical Coding Rules, and deep-dive Task Skills into one seamless experience.

Key Highlights:
✅ Global Sync Engine: Deploy your local rules and skills to Claude/Antigravity with a single command.
✅ Multi-OS Support: Native installers for Windows (PowerShell), Linux, and macOS.
✅ Verified Integrity: Standardized standards for Python, TypeScript, and Go with deep-link intelligence.

Building software with AI is no longer just about prompts; it's about building a robust ecosystem of intelligence.

**Title**: [Showcase] Everything Antigravity: A Modular Framework for AI-Driven Development (Rules, Skills, & Agents)

Hey everyone! I've been working on a system to make AI-assisted coding more predictable and high-performance. Today, I'm launching **Everything Antigravity v1.0.0**.

The core idea is the **Triad Pattern**:
1. **Agents (13 Specialists)**: Personas for every stage of the SDLC (Architect, Planner, Code Reviewer, Build Error Resolver, E2E Runner, TDD Guide, and language-specific reviewers for Python, Go, and SQL).
2. **Rules (Multi-layered)**: Hierarchical constraints (Common principles + language extensions for Python, TypeScript, and Go).
3. **Skills (30 Deep Modules)**: Atomic "How-To" instructions for complex tasks like API Docs, Security Audits, SpringBoot Patterns, and Continuous Learning loops.

**Why use it?**
- **One-Command Sync**: It includes a global installer (`install.py`) that syncs all your local rules, skills, and workflows to the global Claude/Antigravity directories.
- **Cross-Platform**: Native support for Windows (PowerShell), Linux, and macOS.
- **Battle-Tested**: A wide range of skills covering everything from Nutrient Document Processing to ClickHouse IO.

I'd love to get your feedback on the architecture and how you're using agents in your own workflows!
